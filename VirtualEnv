# Make test environment
mkvirtualenv test

# Enter test environment
workon test

# Leave test environment
deactivate

# Delete test environment

# NOTE:
All virtual environments have pip automatically installed, never call pip with sudo in your virtual environment, because this will use the system wide pip.
